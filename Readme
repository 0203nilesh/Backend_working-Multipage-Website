-->Here in this file I am using Node Js and Express Js and as a template engine I am using the Express-handlebars.

-->Here I want to add some notes for future references 
    1. Img folder must be inside of Static folder and while writing down the path of img than you just have to use like this " Img/1.jpeg"" 
    2.For reference of the Express-handlebars. You must refer to it's git directory.
    3.Express-handlebars folder must be like below
    ---Node_modules
    ---package.log.json
    ---package.json
    ---Readme
    ---static
    ---views
       |---layouts
           |---main.handlebars
       |---home.handlebars
       |---Additiona.handlebars
    ---Index.Js

    4.main.handlebars cotainer the basic layout of the page and where your want the content of the other handlebars file which is present outside the layouts folder. For this your can specify the location of that contianer using the "{{{body}}}"
